        <h2>TO: BASH</h2> 
        <h2>RECIEVED AT: BOULDER, CO</h2>
        <h2>DATED: JANUARY 30TH, 1963</h2>
      </div>
      <p>My Loving BASH,</p>
      <p>I have fallen in love with your simplistic interface, a beautiful <b>terminal</b> through which I can interact with you. You create passion with a simple <b>touch</b>, navigate your interface through <b>cd</b>, and with such <b>nano</b> movements, you let me edit your files.</p>
      <p>My heart reaches out to you. Sometimes I wonder how you can keep track of so many directories — how can I keep up when you're so fast? But then I remember, with your strong <b>pwd</b>, that I can find you at any time. </p>
      <p>You're not a machine of words. In fact, sometimes I relegate in the silence <b>..</b> That's when I know you're returning to the previous directory. When you do speak, though, you're so elegant; you <b>ls</b> out all the files in a directory, and do it with precision.</p>
      <p>What amazes me the most, however, is your ability to let me connect and upload to any server. Who needs a GUI for file transferring? Not I. I love you for who you are, your whole <b>ssh user@host</b> self. My devotion is entirely for you, my love. Return to me, and we shall take on the world with our passion. <i>Together...</i>
