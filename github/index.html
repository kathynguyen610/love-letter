					<p>Dear Github, I'm so excited that we got to meet! I had a good time...exploring your repos, looking at your forks. It was really interesting!
					</p>
					<p>When I need to pull from my own repo, I just need a <b>git clone</b> and add my url at the end! It's so easy, and that means I can just edit my code anywhere! You're so great for letting me do that. 
					</p>
					<p>
					When I need to update my code, I only need a <b>git push</b> from you. I may need to log in sometimes, but only once per session! It's so easy, I can push and <b>pull</b> from your repositories. 
					</p>
					<p>I'm so glad we agreed on an open relationship, that just makes everything better! I can look at my friend's repos as well, and take advantage of <b>versioning</b>, so we can all work on a repo at once! I can just <b>reset</b> if I don't like someone, and I prefer it that way!
					</p>
					<p>Anyways, I have to go, but ilu u so much!!! See u soon...-Kathy</p>
