  			<p>Dear Git,</p>
        <p>OMG...I can't believe I thought I used to be in love with you! You used to be so great...so forgiving. I could just undo anything I said or sent to you...that was soo good-but your bad was so BAD!</p>
        <p>I first started liking you through bash. With a <b>git init</b>, I could initiate a local repository through you, and when I asked <b>git status</b>, I know exactly what you were thinking.</p>
        <p>And then I accidentally added a submodule. I don't know how, but you made it so DIFFICULT to remove! I searched everywhere...all the steps were so complicated! I couldn't even do a <b>git rm  submodule </b> like you told me to! You're so CONFUSING. I had to recreate my folders again!</p>
        <p>Whenever I wanted to <b>git commit -m</b>, to commit my updated files, I hated when you made me <b>git add</b> everything first! I always forgot, and you would yell at me for not adding files to the tracking list...So TERRIBLE!!!</p>
        <p>Not only did you YELL at me, you also CHEATED on me. A <b>git branch</b> was all it took to experiment with machines outside of the main branch--ME. I can't believe you would do that, and to offer to <b>git merge</b> as well! You replaced me with another branch! I can't believe it. I'm breaking up with you and I'm leaving you FOREVER!!!!</p>
        <p>Goodbye !!!!!! -Kathy
